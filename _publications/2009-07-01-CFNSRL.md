excerpt: 'Currently, the bottle-neck of natural language processing technologies is the automatic semantic parsing, especially the parsing of sentential meaning. As an important step of semantic analysis, semantic role labeling of lexical units is one of  the formalized representations of propositional meaning of the sentence. Automatical semantic role labeling based on Chinese FrameNet is a formalized representation of Chinese sentences. The automatic construction of large scale semantic corpus and the improvement of natural language processing technologies, e.g. Chinese information retrival task, Chinese question answering system, Chinese information extraction technique and etc., will be achieved along with the further research of automatic semantic role labeling based on Chinese FrameNet.
Due to the lack of an accurate Chinese syntactic parser，it is infeasible to adopt the SRL approach on English FrameNet. Therefore, we formulate the Chinese FrameNet semantic role labeling problem as a sequence labeling task, and use conditional random fields model to solve the problem at the word-level and base-chunk-level respectively. In this thesis, the task of Chinese FrameNet semantic role labeling is defined as: Given a Chinese sentence, a target word and its frame, identify the boundaries of frame elements within the sentence and label them with a appropriate frame element name.
We select 25 Frames from current Chinese FrameNet Corpus in terms of the count of sentences, and split them into training set and testing set according to the proportion of 5:5. 
In the word-based labeling model, we construct several features at word-level, and employ orthogonal array to select the best feature template. The model achieves 62.50% F-measure, which is the baseline result we get. Furthermore, we parse all sentences in the corpus using the TsingHua Base-Chunk parser, and employ the base-chunk features into word-based labeling mode. The result on the test data set achieves 63.65% F-measure, which increase around 1% to the baseline result. The experimental analysis demos that the main effect of the model performance is the sparsity of word feature.
In the base-chunk-based labeling model, several shallow syntactic features are constructed based on the automatic labeling information of Chinese Base-Chunk. Similar to the word-based labeling model, we employ orthogonal array to select the best feature template. On the test data set, the best-chunk-based labeling model achieves 62.11% F-measure, which is decreased by 0.4% to the baseline result. The F-measures of the majority of 25 Frames have significant decreases compared with the baseline results. The main reason is the accuracy of Chinese Base-Chunk parser is relatively low. 
Finally, we conclude the thesis and summarize some problems in the perspective of the semantic role labeling model and machine learning technology, and provide some directions for further research.'
