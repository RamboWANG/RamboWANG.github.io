title: "Bayes Test of Precision, Recall, and F$_1$ Measure for Comparison of Two Natural Language Processing Models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-07-28-ACL
excerpt: 'Direct comparison on point estimation of the precision (P), recall (R), and F$_1$ measure of two natural language processing (NLP) models on a common test corpus is unreasonable and results in less replicable conclusions due to a lack of a statistical test. However, the existing $t$-tests in cross-validation (CV) for model comparison are inappropriate because the distributions of P, R, F$_1$ are skewed and an interval estimation of P, R, and F$_1$ based on a $t$-test may exceed [0,1].  In this study, we propose to use a block-regularized $3\times 2$ CV ($3\times 2$ BCV) in model comparison because it could regularize the difference in certain frequency distributions over linguistic units between training and validation sets and yield stable estimators of P, R, and F$_1$.  On the basis of the $3\times 2$ BCV, we calibrate the posterior distributions of P, R, and F$_1$ and derive an accurate interval estimation of P, R, and F$_1$. Furthermore, we formulate the comparison into a hypothesis testing problem and propose a novel Bayes test. The test could directly compute the probabilities of the hypotheses on the basis of the posterior distributions and provide more informative decisions than the existing significance $t$-tests. Three experiments with regard to NLP chunking tasks are conducted, and the results illustrate the validity of the Bayes test.'

Direct comparison on point estimation of the precision (P), recall (R), and F$_1$ measure of two natural language processing (NLP) models on a common test corpus is unreasonable and results in less replicable conclusions due to a lack of a statistical test. However, the existing $t$-tests in cross-validation (CV) for model comparison are inappropriate because the distributions of P, R, F$_1$ are skewed and an interval estimation of P, R, and F$_1$ based on a $t$-test may exceed [0,1].  In this study, we propose to use a block-regularized $3\times 2$ CV ($3\times 2$ BCV) in model comparison because it could regularize the difference in certain frequency distributions over linguistic units between training and validation sets and yield stable estimators of P, R, and F$_1$.  On the basis of the $3\times 2$ BCV, we calibrate the posterior distributions of P, R, and F$_1$ and derive an accurate interval estimation of P, R, and F$_1$.
