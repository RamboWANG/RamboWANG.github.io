excerpt: 'Semantic role identification is an important task for semantic parsing according to Chinese FrameNet. Based on distributed representations of Chinese words, the part-of-speech and other symbolic features, we build our semantic role identification model by employing a kind of multi-feature-integrated neural network architecture. Due to the relative small training corpus, we adopt the dropout regularization to improve quality of the training process. Experimental results indicate that, 1) dropout regularization can effectively alleviate over-fitting of our model, and 2) the F-measure increases upto 7%. With further optimization of the learning rate and the pre-trained word embeddings, the final F-measure of our semantic role identification model reaches 70.54%, which is about 2% higher than the state-of-the-art result.'
